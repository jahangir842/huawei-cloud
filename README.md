# Huawei Cloud Solution Architect Learning Project

This repository contains resources, code, and documentation for learning Huawei Cloud Solution Architecture.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a practical implementation companion to the [Huawei Solution Architect Learning Plan](huawei-solution-architect-learning-plan.md). It provides a structured environment to practice and apply Huawei Cloud concepts using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Huawei Cloud Account](https://www.huaweicloud.com/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v1.0.0+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Huawei Cloud CLI](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/cli/index.html)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd huawei-cloud
   ```

2. Configure your Huawei Cloud credentials:
   - Update the `terraform/terraform.tfvars` file with your access and secret keys
   - Alternatively, set environment variables:
     ```
     export HUAWEICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY="your-access-key"
     export HUAWEICLOUD_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
     ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```

4. Apply the base infrastructure:
   ```
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

1. **Basic Infrastructure**: VPC, subnets, security groups
2. **Compute Resources**: ECS instances, auto scaling groups
3. **Storage Solutions**: OBS buckets, EVS volumes
4. **Database Services**: RDS instances, backups
5. **Application Services**: Load balancers, CDN
6. **Advanced Services**: Containers, serverless functions
7. **Complete Architecture**: Multi-tier application with high availability
